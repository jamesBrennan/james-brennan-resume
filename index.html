My core competencies are <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Rails</strong>,
<strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>CoffeeScript</strong>, and <strong>modern CSS/HTML</strong>.</p><p>I love agile software development. Nothing feels better than building something cool with smart people. Test driven development makes
me feel safe and confident in my work.</p><p>Currently I'm loving working with AngularJS and other emerging javascript technologies. On my last project we relied on JSON Schema to
validate and document complex data structures. I'm looking forward to making some open source contributions to tooling around JSON Schema.</p><p>I'm seeking contract positions that leverage, and hopefully stretch, my expertise and experience as a full stack web developer.</p></div><div class="employment"><header class="page-header"><h1>Employment</h1></header><div class="company row"><header class="col-sm-3"><h1><a alt="Carbon Five" href="http://www.carbonfive.com">Carbon Five </a><span class="date">Feb, 2007 - Present</span></h1></header><div class="description col-sm-9"><p>Over seven years at Carbon Five I've been involved in dozens of projects for almost as many different companies.
Here are a select list of projects:</p><ul><li><h1><a alt="SF MOMA 2012 Annual Report" href="http://carbonfive.com/project/sfmoma-annual-report">SF MOMA 2012 Annual Report</a></h1><p>I Worked with a Carbon Five designer and SFMOMA staff to implement their 2012 annual report as a parallax scrolling web page.
Responsible for entire implementation, from the technology choices to the final css tweaks.</p></li><li><h1><a alt="Bedsider" href="http://carbonfive.com/project/bedsider">Bedsider</a></h1><p>After initial design and ideation with IDEO, The National Campaign worked with Carbon Five to build Bedsider.com, a resource
for young women to learn about birth control. I contributed mainly on the front end, working on markup and css for the whole site.
Most significantly I was responsible for the implementation of the map functionality in the "<a href='http://bedsider.org/where_to_get_it'>Where To Get It</a>" section.</p></li><li><h1><a alt="Manilla.com" href="https://www.manilla.com/">Manilla</a></h1><p>I was part of a large team to help implement the ruby backend and web/mobile frontend for Manilla.com. Manilla was built from the ground up
to be modular and scalable. As part of the team responsible for getting the first version of the project built and
brought to market I contributed daily on all layers, from writing SQL data migrations to work on the several rails apps to
making sure the views were pixel perfect.</p></li><li><h1><a alt="ITVS.org" href="http://www.itvs.org">ITVS</a></h1><p>I was the person primarily responsible for the front end implementation of ITVS, including all CSS/HTML and javascript interactivity. The most
fun and challenging part of the project was to implement the designers concise vision with ever-changing content.</p></li><li><h1><a alt="Imfuna Rent Pro" href="http://carbonfive.com/project/rent-pro">Imfuna - Rent Pro</a></h1><p>I was brought in as part of a team to help refactor and solidify an existing app that had been developed with speed-to-market as a top priority
and code quality and test coverage, distant seconds. I worked to refactor and test both the front-end CSS/HTML and the ruby code.</p></li><li><h1><a alt="JobYou" href="http://carbonfive.com/project/jobyou">JobYou</a></h1><p>JobYou was designed to help entry level job applicants find work that is suited to their temperaments in the hope that doing so would lead to
increased job satisfaction for workers and, as a result, lower turnover for their employers. I was part of a team that implemented a modern
interactive personality test for prospective employees.</p></li><li><h1>Many More ...</h1><p>I typically work on about four projects a year. Having been with Carbon Five for seven years that works out to close to 30 projects, each with
it's own challenges and triumphs. Some other interesting clients include, Square, Wonderful, DNA Direct, and many more.
I'd be happy to talk about my experiences at length. Just ask!</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="company row"><header class="col-sm-3"><h1><a alt="Silverpoint" href="http://www.silverpoint.net/">Silverpoint</a><span class="explanation">Aquired by Finalsite in 2013</span><span class="date">Feb, 2005 - Feb, 2007</span></h1></header><div class="description col-sm-9"><p>Silverpoint was a web development shop focused on providing websites to independent schools.
